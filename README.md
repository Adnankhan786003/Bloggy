# 📖 Bloggy

**Bloggy** is a *basic blog application* built with **React** and **Firebase**.  
It lets users **sign up**, **log in**, and **create blog posts** using the **Jodit Rich Text Editor**.  
Posts are saved in **Firestore** and displayed inside the app.

⚠️ **Note:** Bloggy is still under development — it is *not mobile responsive* yet, and **editing posts does not update them in real time**.
